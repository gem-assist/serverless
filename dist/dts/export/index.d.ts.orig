/**
 * We export the pg library mostly unchanged, but we do make a few tweaks.
 *
 * (1) Connecting and querying can require a lot of network round-trips. We
 * add a pipelining option for the connection (startup + auth + first query),
 * but this works with cleartext password auth only. We can also pipeline TLS
 * startup, but currently this works only with Neon hosts (not vanilla pg or
 * pgbouncer).
 *
 * (2) SCRAM auth is deliberately CPU-intensive, and this is not appropriate
 * for a serverless environment. In case it is still used, however, we replace
 * the standard (synchronous) pg implementation with one that uses SubtleCrypto
 * for repeated SHA-256 digests. This saves some time and CPU.
 *
 * (3) We now (experimentally) redirect Pool.query over a fetch request if the
 * circumstances are right.
