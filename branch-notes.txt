In this branch, I tried manually eliminating dead code from the Buffer package.

The unused methods I could identify save about 10KB (out of 137KB) on the bundled package.

However: node-postgres can return a Buffer (e.g. for a bytea column), which the user could conceivably want to use these methods on.

So I'm regarding this as a dead-end.
